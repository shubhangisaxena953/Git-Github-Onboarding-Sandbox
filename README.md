# Git/GitHub Onboarding Sandbox

Git/GitHub Onboarding Sandbox is a beginner-friendly to-do app built for total Git and GitHub beginners at a Hacktoberfest event. The app is intentionally simple because the real goal is practicing how to fork a repository, create a branch, make a change, commit it, push it to GitHub, and open a pull request.

Screenshot placeholder: a real app screenshot will be added here later.

## Quickstart

1. Fork this repository on GitHub by clicking **Fork**.
2. Clone your fork, replacing `<your-username>` with your GitHub username:

	```text
	git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Git-Github-Onboarding-Sandbox.git
	cd Git-Github-Onboarding-Sandbox
	```

3. Run the app you want to try by opening its file in your browser after cloning:
	- `todo/index.html`
	- `notes/index.html`
	- `expenses/index.html`
4. Create a branch before making changes:

	```text
	git checkout -b my-first-change
	```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contribution flow.

## Structure

- `todo/`, `notes/`, `expenses/` — the three mini-apps
- `exercises/` — Git practice exercises (see the issue list)
- `contributors/` — where each contributor adds their intro file

Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build step.
